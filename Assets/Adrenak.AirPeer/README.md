# AirPeer
A WebRTC based networking plugin for Unity3D.

## Intro
 AirPeer allows Unity applications to communicate in a peer to peer manner using [WebRTC technology](https://webrtc.org/).

Built on top of [Christoph Kutza's WebRTC project](https://www.because-why-not.com/webrtc/) with added features such as
- Differentiating peers into server and clients
- For client to client communication (via server)
- Event based API
- Message (de)serialization features

## Signalling Server
A directory called `server` in the repository root contains a node implementation for a signalling server. This can be run using NPM. Find the README inside the folder.
